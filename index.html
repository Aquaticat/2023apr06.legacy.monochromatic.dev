    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  </summary>

  <p>
    Monochromatic aims to define some sensible sets of styling for text-heavy websites.
    <br>
    For example, a personal blog made of blog posts or a manual organized in chapters.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why choose this name?
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Only <strong>pure black</strong> and <strong>pure white</strong> are allowed.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Only the styling necessary for conveying the semantic meaning of each element and its surrounding context are
        made.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Only the animations that are necessary are allowed.
        At the same time, the animation cannot be something that
        updates too much of the view, takes too much time, or has too many <code>@keyframes</code>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Only one stylesheet and one script is allowed for each variation. This:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            reduces maintenance costs
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            improves performance if the user visits more than one page.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Hence <code>&quot;Monochromatic&quot;</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why write documents in HTML instead of a lightweight markup language using Markdown?
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        HTML gives more control over Markdown. Here are some requirements only achievable using HTML.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> for headings and its content in order to let user freely fold those sections.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Styling and scripting.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

      </summary>

      <p><strong>M</strong></p>

      <p>
        Why choose this name?
      </p>

      <p>
        Both <code>Muscari</code> and <code>Monochromatic</code> start with the letter M.
        <br>
        Meaning this variant of &quot;sensible set of styling&quot; is closest to what the name of the project conveys.
        Unassuming but still provides a modern reading experience.
      </p>

      <p>Specific rules:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Use the simplest style.
          <br>
          If using a simpler style, like using a normal border instead of using a double border,
          would still sufficiently convey the semantic meaning of the element and the surrounding context,
          <br>
          use the simpler style instead of the fancier one
          even when the fancier style can convey the meaning better or is more aesthetically pleasing.
          <br>
          This variant has the fewest requirements on how well the semantic meanings should be expressed.
        </li>

        <li>
          Always use a sans-serif font.
          <br>
          For example, titles, paragraphs, references, comments.
          Reasons:
          <ol>
            <li>
              The font family <a href="https://rsms.me/inter">Inter</a> is specifically designed for modern electronic
              devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sans-serif fonts have much fewer details than serif fonts, by definition.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using only one font family throughout the entire website reduces the data need to access it.
              In other words, avoid performance loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              People are used to reading sans-serif fonts on websites since most websites use them instead of serif
              fonts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Titles look more modern when using a sans-serif font family.
            </li>
            <li>
              All Operating Systems' default sans-serif font families are readable.
              If the external font fails to load, the website would still look okay-ish.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            No animations are allowed.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Use built-in styling and element appearance adjustments instead of removing them and put my own there
            instead.
          </p>

          <p>

          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

          Subdirectory <code>Afzelia</code>
        </h4>
      </summary>

      <p><strong>A</strong></p>

      <p>Why choose this name?</p>

      <p>
        The alphabet starts with <strong>A</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this variant of &quot;sensible set of styling&quot;,
        Fancier styling can be used
        when there are big improvements to the expressiveness of semantic meanings compared to simpler styling.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            For example, consider
            using double borders on the <code>inline-start</code> side of the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element
            instead of using a normal, simple border
            <br>
            because a double border can better differentiate the appearance of blockquotes from message tip blocks.
            A double border can also imply the content on the right side is a page from a book,
            which is a desirable effect for blockquotes that are often quoted from books.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Sans-serif font can be used sparingly, like in some headings or comments.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Simple animations like animation the transformation of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> underlines to a rectangle
            behind them is allowed.
            Both the shape and the color.
          </p>

          <p>
            The use of <code>animation-timing-function</code> is allowed.
          </p>

    <h2>What this project is not.</h2>
  </summary>

  <p>
    The code written in this project is mainly used for demonstration.
  </p>

  <p>
    I<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup> do not seek to write high-quality code.
    Therefore, lots of coding standards are not followed and lots of common linters are not applied.
    Expect poor optimization and lots of duplicate code.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, due to the advancements in modern devices&apos; computing capacity, most of these code snippets should work
    well
    enough,
    if not faster, than using a heavyweight frontend framework.
    Therefore, I believe it&apos;s still important and meaningful to publish my implementations.
